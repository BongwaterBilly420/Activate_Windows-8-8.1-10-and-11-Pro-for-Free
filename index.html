<p>A guide how to get and activate Windows 8, 8.1, 10 <strong>and</strong> 11 Pro for free!</p>
<h4 id="-note-"><strong>NOTE</strong></h4>
<p>If you see the Windows keyboard button <kbd><img src="https://svgshare.com/i/dg_.svg" width="11"></kbd> in this guide; and you can&#39;t find it on your keyboard, you likely have/had Windows 10 which has the button <kbd><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Font_Awesome_5_brands_windows.svg" width="11"></kbd>. If you can&#39;t find that one, you likely have a PC that has been upgraded to Windows 8/8.1/10/11 from Windows 8.1/8/7/Vista/XP and other ones. If you have one of those, refer the Windows key button to as yours. A list of them is below:</p>
<h4 id="windows-key-buttons">Windows key buttons</h4>
<p><kbd><img src="https://svgshare.com/i/dg_.svg" width="11"></kbd> - Windows 11</p>
<p><kbd><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Font_Awesome_5_brands_windows.svg" width="11"></kbd> - Windows 10</p>
<p><kbd><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/Windows_logo_2012-Black.svg" width="11"></kbd> - Windows 8/8.1</p>
<p><kbd><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Windows_logo_-_2002%E2%80%932012_%28Black%29.svg" width="11"></kbd> - Windows XP/Vista/7</p>
<p><kbd><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Windows_logo_-_1992_%28black%29.svg" width="11"></kbd> - Windows 95/98</p>
<p><ins>This doesn&#39;t say that your PC currently runs an older version of Windows. It is just the logo from the Windows version it came with. Your PC can always be upgraded to a newer version of Windows if it runs 64-bit and has a good CPU and GPU.</ins></p>

There are so many reasons why you want to upgrade! A few famous features which you provide of:</li>
<li>BitLocker - Used to better secure your storage drive in case it is stolen or for any other reason.</li>
<li>Remote Desktop - Used to access your PC from anywhere by enabling a connection to your device.</li>
<li>Domain or Azure Active Directory - Used to make it possible to place the PC in a domain or use Azure Active Directory.<h2 id="-create-a-restore-point-"><strong>CREATE A RESTORE POINT!!!</strong></h2>
Create a restore point to make sure you can roll back if something doesn&#39;t work, or anything goes wrong. You can find a tool to easily do this below.<h3 id="restore-point-tool">Restore Point Tool</h3>
The Restore Point Tool is a good tool using Batch to create a Windows restore point automatically so that you can rollback to your previous Windows edition. If needed, you can later on restore to this point to make everything working again.<h3 id="tool-usage">Tool Usage</h3>
</li>
<li>Download the tool from <a href="https://mega.nz/file/LhdWGTKL#Tc9-y6bsJ8xdaGG86sjrEmQLuhaCO2IdsfPe2udUGqk">here</a>.</li>
<li>Run the file as administrator.</li>
<li>Wait some time. You will see some text that it is working on some things.</li>
<li>When it is done, it will prompt &#39;Create restore point done!&#39;.</li>
<li>It will exit, and your restore point is created!<h3 id="restore-procedure">Restore Procedure</h3>
</li>
<li>Open Settings (Not Control Panel).</li>
<li>Go to &#39;Info&#39; or &#39;Information&#39;.</li>
<li>Go down until you see &#39;Advanced System Settings&#39; at &#39;Device Specifications&#39;.</li>
<li>Click on it.</li>
<li>Go to &#39;System Security&#39; section.</li>
<li>Click on &#39;System Restore&#39;.</li>
<li>Click on the box at &#39;Select a different restore point&#39;.</li>
<li>Select the first restore point in the list.</li>
<li>Click on &#39;Next&#39;.</li>
<li>Click on &#39;Complete&#39;.</li>
<li>Wait until the process is done.
It should now be restored to your previous edition of Windows!<h2 id="-backup-your-current-key-"><strong>BACKUP YOUR CURRENT KEY!!!</strong></h2>
Backup the activation key you are currently using. This is to make sure that if the process doesn&#39;t work, you can reinstall Windows/change the edition and enter your current key, so that you can access everything again.
This only applies when:</li>
<li>You have buyed a key online.</li>
<li>It isn&#39;t connected to your Microsoft Account and is no digital license.
If you have a Microsoft account with a digital license, you don&#39;t need to worry.<h2 id="use-third-method-for-permanent-activation-">Use Third Method for PERMANENT Activation!</h2>
Third is for users with PERMANENT activation. This requires you to have a Microsoft account connected with Windows. Find it by <a href="#method-3-for-activating-windows-pro-permanent">clicking here</a>. <strong>The first and second methods are NOT PERMANENT</strong>.<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
Q: Am I also able to switch from any other edition to Pro?</li>
</ul>
<p>A: The answer is almost yes! You can switch from almost any edition to Pro completely for free!</p>
<p>Q: Will I lose my activation key?</p>
<p>A: No, you shouldn&#39;t lose your key. It doesn&#39;t care which type you have (Key, HWID, Digital license, etc.). Built-in keys should be reactivated when reinstalling Windows, although this isn&#39;t always the case. A seperate key can just be copied and stored somewhere, which you could enter again later on (rollback first needed for this). Digital licenses are connected to your Microsoft account, so if you login it should restore automatically.</p>
<p>Q: Which upgradeable version are currently working?</p>
<p>A: If you&#39;re on Home edition, it is likely that it can be upgraded to Pro. Most other editions are also supported as well. There are a few which might not work.</p>
<h2 id="note-for-users-with-unactivated-pro-edition">Note for Users with Unactivated Pro Edition</h2>
<p>People which already have Pro, but not activated, can skip to <a href="https://gist.github.com/Minionguyjpro/d913b3931e844ad8ad9a758a4aca4b63#activating-windows-pro">this step</a>.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry. You need to run the script again, but a recommendation: <strong>For users which used this guide to activate with the first or second method and now get this message everytime, use the third method to activate it forever. But it requires a Microsoft account. When using Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, the third method won&#39;t work.</strong></p>
